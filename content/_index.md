The Free Explorers is an [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/free-explorers) of passionate individuals committed to funding and collaborating on innovative open-source projects.

{{< open_collective_button >}}

We believe that the future of our digital world should be open, transparent, and belong to everyone. That's why we support those who dedicate their lives to building the technologies of tomorrow: the Architects.

To ensure the delivery of high-quality projects and their long-term sustainability, we are focused on funding the talented people behind these initiatives, inspiring others to join this important mission.

As an Explorer, you not only contribute to funding the work of the Architects but also gain the opportunity to participate in decision-making processes and receive support across various projects.
